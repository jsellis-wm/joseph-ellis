I am the Supervisor of Accountability and Assessment for New Kent County Public Schools in New Kent, VA. With regard to accountability, I manage all federal program grants, including Titles I, II, III, and IV. This includes writing the grants and tracking necessary metrics, creating the budget based on government allocations, and approving spending of grant funds. Additionally, I serve as the Division Hearing Officer, acting as the superintendent's designee in matter of discipline that elevate beyond the individual school level. 

With regard to assessment, I serve as the Division Director of Testing, managing the administration of all federal and state standardized testing administrations throughout the school year. I manage the school division's local assessment platform, assisting staff create and administer formative assessments to students in all grades. Finally, I conduct analyses on numerous disparate student data sources to provide division leadership with the information needed to steer improvement efforts.

Previously, I was the Supervisor of Instructional Data for Newport News Public Schools in Newport News, VA. In my role, I managed the local assessment platform and supervised the analysis of numerous formative and summative assessment data sets. I collaborated with the Youth Development department to analyze and find patterns in student discipline data. I co-chaired the Student Discipline Task Force, working to find and root-out bias in student discipline practices and presented the findings to the school board. 

I am currently a student in the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA. I enjoy using data to solve problems and am particularly fond of R scripting and building web applications using the .NET framework. With my background in K-12 education, I have a deep interest in using machine learning algorithms to develop data-informed solutions to the day-to-day business of students, teachers, and school administrators.
